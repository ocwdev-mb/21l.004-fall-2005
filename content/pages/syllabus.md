A list of topics covered in the course is presented in the [calendar](#Calendar) below.

Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Work Expectations
-----------------

### Written Work

1.  Shakespeare Paper (Lec #9) (counts as 5 pages)
2.  Monologue for Milton's Satan (Lec #11) (5 pages)
3.  Paper on _Frankenstein_, monsters, and intertextuality (Lec #16) (6-7 pages)
4.  Revision Option: revise **either** your Shakespeare paper or your _Frankenstein_ paper. In class we'll discuss terms of revision and redrafting; you choose which of your papers you want to revise. (**Either** 1 day after Lec #12 or Lec #18)
5.  Close Reading (Lec #23) (5 pages)
6.  Memorize a short poem (over 12 lines, less than 50) and come to class prepared to recite it and to explain your reasons for choosing it. (Some time after Lec #19)

**No late papers.** This rule follows from the shape of knowledge in the field; poets read other poets, and poems follow from and speak back (and forward) to other poems. Late papers, or papers out of sequence, violate this rhythm of intertextuality.

### Other Work

1.  Attentive reading. Read each major poem five times. This careful attention should take hours; yes, it's possible to skim them and to come to class with only a superficial experience of them, but what's the point?
2.  Regular and responsible attendance
3.  Careful listening, contributions as a good participant and as an engaged, integrative listener

Because one cannot authentically participate with the skills of a discussion or of a listener without being present, let's assume that anyone who misses more than a class-meeting or two **will be asked to drop the subject.**

CI Designation
--------------

This subject is one that fulfills the Communication Intensive (CI) requirements. All students must take one CI subject in each of their four undergraduate years: two CI subjects as part of their HASS requirement and two CI subjects as Part of their undergraduate program. In this class, requirements will be satisfied by:

1.  The oral component (daily discussions, oral presentations during the last weeks of the term),
2.  Completion of the essays plus the responses to the "study questions", amounting to a total of more than 20 pages, and
3.  A revision and resubmission of one of the formal essay assignments.

Grading
-------

I try to be decent. If forced to give a formula for grading, I'd say

*   Slightly over 1/2 on your written work
*   Slightly under 1/2 on your other work for the term and
*   My sense of whether you've learned something

MIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism
--------------------------------------

Plagiarism--the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement--is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the professor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information received from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available on the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/) and the [MIT Web site on Plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/).
